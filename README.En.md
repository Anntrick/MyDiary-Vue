[中文](README.md)        
## Introduction
This app comes from a popular and high-quality Japanese animated film [Your Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name)      
I like the diary application very much,so I copied [the app](https://github.com/ssshooter/MyDiary) immediately with jquery                
After that, I learned Vue for a while, and familiar gradually, and I want to know more about the Vue ecosystem        
After reading some guide in official site, there is still something difficult to understand           
So I decided to refactor Mydiary       
The front and back ends of the project are separated             
back-end: RESTful API([MyDiary API](https://github.com/ssshooter/MyDiary-API)) implemented with nodejs and express    
database: mongoDB        
font-end: vue2 / vuex / vue-router / webpack / ES6  / less
